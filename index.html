                    Ask somebody in the building industry to visually communicate the architecture of a building and you'll be presented with site plans, floor plans, elevation views, cross-section views and detail drawings.
                    In contrast, ask a software developer to communicate the software architecture of a software system using diagrams and you'll likely get a confused mess of boxes and lines.                </p>

                    As an industry, we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), ArchiMate and SysML,
                    but asking whether these provide an effective way to communicate software architecture is often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown them out in favour of much simpler "boxes and lines" diagrams.
                    Abandoning these modelling languages is one thing but, perhaps in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually.
                </p>

                <h3>Maps of your code</h3>
                <p>
                    The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.
                    It's a way to create maps of your code, at various levels of detail, in the same way you would use something like Google Maps to zoom in and out of an area you are interested in. 
                </p>

                            Like source code, Google Street View provides a very low-level and accurate view of a location.

                            Zooming out further will provide additional context you might not have been aware of.

                            Different levels of zoom allow you to tell different stories to different audiences.

                    Although primarily aimed at software architects and developers, the C4 model provides a way for software development teams to efficiently and effectively communicate their
                    software architecture, at different levels of detail, telling different stories to different types of audience.
                    The C4 model is an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how
                    software architects and developers think about and build software. The small set of abstractions and diagram types makes the C4 model
                    easy to learn and use.

                <p>
                    In order to create these maps of your code, we first need a common set of abstractions to create a ubiquitous language that we can use to describe the static structure of a software system.
                    The C4 model considers the static structures of a <b>software system</b> in terms of <b>containers</b>, <b>components</b> and <b>code</b>.
                    And <b>people</b> use the software systems that we build.

                            However you think about your users (as actors, roles, personas, etc), people are the various human users of your software system.

                        <p class="small">
                            A software system is the highest level of abstraction and describes something that delivers value to its users, whether they are human or not. This includes the software system you are modelling, and the other software systems upon which your software system depends (or vice versa).

                            A container represents something that hosts code or data. A container is something that needs to
                            be running in order for the overall software system to work. In real terms, a container is something like:

                            <li><b>Client-side web application</b>: A JavaScript application running in a web browser using  Angular, Backbone.JS, jQuery, etc).</li>
                            <li><b>Client-side desktop application</b>: A Windows desktop application written using WPF, an OS X desktop application written using Objective-C, a cross-platform desktop application written using JavaFX, etc.</li>

                            <li><b>Blob or content store</b>: A blob store (e.g. Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, etc) or content delivery network (e.g. Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, etc).</li>
                            <li><b>File system</b>: A full local file system or a portion of a larger networked file system (e.g. SAN, NAS, etc).</li>

                        <p class="small">
                            A container is essentially a context or boundary inside which some code is executed or some data is stored.
                            And each container is a separately deployable/runnable thing or runtime environment, typically (but not always) running in its own process space.
                            Because of this, communication between containers typically takes the form of an inter-process communication.

                        <h3>Component</h3>
                        <p class="small">
                            The word "component" is a hugely overloaded term in the software development industry, but in this context a component is simply a grouping of related functionality encapsulated behind a well-defined interface.
                            If you're using a language like Java or C#, the simplest way to think of a component is that it's a collection of implementation classes behind an interface. Aspects such as how those components are packaged (e.g. one component vs many components per JAR file, DLL, shared library, etc) is a separate and orthogonal concern.
                        </p>
                        <p class="small">
                            An important point to note here is that all components inside a container typically execute in the same process space.

                    Visualising this hierarchy of abstractions is then done by creating a collection of <b>Context</b>, <b>Container</b>, <b>Component</b> and (optionally) <b>Code</b> (e.g. UML class) diagrams.
                    This is where the C4 model gets its name from.

                            A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system,
                            allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system
                            as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Detail isn't important here as this is your zoomed out view showing a big picture of the system landscape.
                            The focus should be on people (actors, roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than technologies,
                            protocols and other low-level details. It's the sort of diagram that you could show to non-technical people.

                        <p>
                            Once you understand how your system fits in to the overall IT environment, a really useful next step is to zoom-in to the system boundary with a Container diagram.
                            A "container" is something like a server-side web application, single-page application, desktop application, mobile app, database schema, file system, etc.
                            Essentially, a container is a separately runnable/deployable unit (e.g. a separate process space) that executes code or stores data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities
                            are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate
                            with one another. It's a simple, high-level technology focussed diagram that is useful for
                            software developers and support/operations staff alike.

                            This level of detail is not recommended for anything but the most important or complex components.

                            The C4 model provides a static view of a <b>single software</b> system but, in the real-world, software systems never live in isolation.
                            For this reason, and particularly if you are responsible for a collection of software systems, it's often useful to understand how all of these software systems fit together within the bounds of an enterprise.
                            To do this, simply add another diagram that sits "on top" of the C4 diagrams, to show the system landscape from an IT perspective. Like the System Context diagram, this diagram can show
                            the organisational boundary, internal/external users and internal/external systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Essentially this is a high-level map of the software systems at the enterprise level, with a C4 drill-down for each software system of interest. From a practical perspective, a system landscape diagram is really just a system context diagram without a specific focus on a particular software system.

                            This dynamic diagram is based upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_diagram">UML communication diagram</a>

                            A deployment node is something like physical infrastructure (e.g. a physical server or device), virtualised infrastructure (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, a virtual machine), containerised infrastructure (e.g. a Docker container), an execution environment (e.g. a database server, Java EE web/application server, Microsoft IIS), etc. Deployment nodes can be nested.

                    You can then use colour and shapes to supplement the diagram, either to add additional information or simply to make the diagram more aesthetically pleasing.

                <h3>C4 and UML</h3>
                <p>
                    Although the example diagrams above are created using a "boxes and lines" notation,
                    the core diagrams can be illustrated using UML with the appropriate use of packages, components and stereotypes. The resulting UML diagrams do tend to lack the same degree of descriptive text though, because adding such text isn't possible (or easy) with some UML tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are three examples of a System Context, Container and Component diagram for comparison.

                <p>
                    Any notation used should be as self-describing as possible, but <b>all diagrams should have a key/legend</b> to make the notation explicit.
                    This applies to diagrams created with notations such as UML, ArchiMate and SysML too, as not everybody will know the notation being used.

                            Although the C4 model is an abstraction-first approach and notation independent, you still need to ensure that your diagram notation makes sense,
                            and that the diagrams are comprehensible.
                            A good way to think about this is to ask yourself whether each diagram can stand alone, and be (mostly) understood without a narrative.

                        <p>
                            The C4 model was inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> and
                            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">4+1 model for software architecture</a>.
                            In summary, you can think of the C4 model as a simplified version of the underlying concepts, designed to
                            (1) make it easier for software developers to describe and understand how a software system works and
                            (2) to minimise the gap between the software architecture model/description and the source code.

                            so the name "container" was chosen as a generic way to describe something in which components live.
                            From one perspective, it's unfortunate that containerisation has become popular, because many software developers now associate the term "container" with Docker.
                            From another perspective though, there is sometimes a nice parity between a container in the C4 model and an infrastructure (e.g. Docker) container.

                        <h3>Can we change the terminology?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This terminology (context, containers, components and code) works for many organisations and many types of software.
                            However, sometimes an organisation will have an existing terminology that people are already familiar with.
                            Or perhaps "components" and "classes" don't easily map on to the technology being used (e.g. functional languages often use the terms "module" and "function").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Feel free to modify the terminology that you use to describe software architecture at different levels of abstraction.
                            Just make sure that everybody explicitly understands it.

                        <p>
                            Broadly speaking, there are two options for diagramming microservices when using the C4 model.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                          <li><b>Microservices as software systems</b>: If your software system has a dependency upon a number of microservices that are outside of your control (e.g. they are owned and/or operated by a separate team), model these microservices as external software systems that you can't see inside of.</li>
                          <li><b>Microservices as containers</b>: On the other hand, if the microservices are a part of a software system that you are building (i.e. you own them), model them as containers, along with any data stores that those microservices use. In the same way that a modular monolithic application is a container with a number of components running inside it, a microservice is simply a container with a (smaller) number of components running inside it.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            The same is true for serverless functions/lambdas/etc; treat them as software systems or containers based upon ownership.

                        <h3>How do you diagram large and complex software systems?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Even with a relatively small software system, it's tempting to try and include the entire story on a single diagram. For example, if you have a web application, it seems logical to create a single component diagram that shows all of the components that make up that web application. Unless your software system really is that small, you're likely to run out of room on the diagram canvas or find it difficult to discover a layout that isn't cluttered by a myriad of overlapping lines. Using a larger diagram canvas can sometimes help, but large diagrams are usually hard to interpret and comprehend because the cognitive load is too high. And if nobody understands the diagram, nobody is going to look at it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, don't be afraid to split that single complex diagram into a larger number of simpler diagrams, each with a specific focus around a business area, functional area, functional grouping, bounded context, use case, user interaction, feature set, etc. The key is to ensure that each of the separate diagrams tells a different part of the same overall story, at the same level of abstraction.

                        <p>
                            Due to the hierarchical nature of the C4 model, each diagram will change at a different rate.
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>System Context diagram</b>: In most cases, the system context diagram will change very slowly, as this describes the landscape that the software system is operating within.</li>
                            <li><b>Container diagram</b>: Unless you're building a software system that makes heavy use of microservices or serverless lambas/functions/etc, the container diagram will also change relatively slowly.</li>
                            <li><b>Component diagram</b>: For any software system under active development, the component diagrams may change frequently as the team adds, removes or restructures the code into cohesive components. Automating the generation of this level of detail with tooling can help.</li>
                            <li><b>Code diagram</b>: The level 4 code (e.g. class) diagrams will potentially become outdated very quickly if the codebase is under active development.

                            Although existing notations such as UML, ArchiMate and SysML already exist, many software development teams don't seem to use them.
                            Often this is because teams don't know these notations well enough, perceive them to be too complicated, think they are not compatible with agile approaches or don't have the required tooling.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are already successfully using one of these notations to communicate software architecture and it's working, stick with it. If not, try the C4 model.
                            And don't be afraid to supplement the C4 diagrams with UML state diagrams, timing diagrams, etc if you need to.

                        <p>
                            A common misconception is that a team's design process should follow the levels in the C4 model hierachy, perhaps with different people on the team being responsible for different levels of diagrams.
                            For example, a business analyst creates the system context diagram, the architect creates the container diagram, while the developers look after the remaining levels of detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although you can certainly use the C4 model in this way, this is not the intended or recommended usage pattern.
                            The C4 model is just a way to describe a software system, from different levels of abstraction, and it implies nothing about the process of delivering software.

                            The C4 model is really designed to model a software system, at various levels of abstraction.
                            To document a library, framework or SDK, you might be better off using something like UML.
                            Alternatively, you could use the C4 model to describe a usage example of your framework, library or SDK; perhaps using colour coding to signify which parts of the software system are bespoke vs those provided for you.

                        <h3>Web applications; one container or two?</h3>
                        <p>
                            If you're building a server-side web application (e.g. Spring MVC, ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, Django, etc) that is predominantly generating static HTML content, then that's a single container.
                            If there's a significant quantity of JavaScript being delivered by the server-side web application (e.g. a single-page application built using Angular), then that's two containers.
                            <a href="./img/bigbankplc-Containers.png">Here's an example</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although, at deployment time, the server-side web application includes both the server-side and client-side code, treating the client and server as two separate containers makes it explicit that these are two separate process spaces, communicating via an inter-process/remote communication mechanism (e.g. JSON/HTTPS).
                            It also provides a basis for zooming in to each container separately to show the components inside them.

                        <h3>Should the lines represent dependencies or data flow?</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is your choice. Sometimes diagrams work better showing dependency relationships (e.g. uses, reads from, etc),
                            and sometimes data flow (e.g. customer update events) works better. Whichever you choose, make sure that the description of the line matches the direction of the arrow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's also worth remembering that most relationships can be expressed either way, and the more explicit you can be, the better.
                            For example, describing a relationship as "sends customer update events to" can be more descriptive than simply "customer update events".

                    "Visualising software architecture with the C4 model" is a hands-on, half-day or full-day workshop with Simon Brown that focusses on the visualisation and communication of software architecture using the C4 model.
                    The core of this workshop can be based upon a simple case study (an architecture kata) or your own software systems.
                </p>

                <h5>Abstract</h5>
                <p>
                    It's very likely that the majority of the software architecture diagrams you've seen are a confused mess of boxes and lines. Following the publication of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001, teams have abandoned UML, discarded the concept of modelling and instead place a heavy reliance on conversations centered around incoherent whiteboard diagrams or shallow "Marketecture" diagrams created with Visio. Moving fast and being agile requires good communication, yet software development teams struggle with this fundamental skill. A good set of software architecture diagrams are priceless for aligning a team around a shared vision and for getting new-joiners productive fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hands-on workshop explores the visual communication of software architecture and is based upon a decade of my experiences working with software development teams large and small across the globe. We'll look at what is commonplace today, the importance of creating a shared vocabulary, diagram notation, and the value of creating a lightweight model to describe your software system. The workshop is based upon the "C4 model", which I created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase. It's a way to create maps of your code, at various levels of detail. Static structure, runtime and deployment diagrams are all covered, so you'll be able to tell different stories to different audiences. We'll wrap up the day by looking at the tooling landscape and diagram automation to keep your diagrams in sync with your source code.                
                </p>

                <h3>Pricing</h3>
                <p>
                    The pricing model is a flat fee, rather than "per attendee", based upon location.
                    The class size is flexible; the recommended number of people is between 10 and 20, although previous courses have been run for between 5 and 150 people.
                    From a logistics point of view, all that is needed is a room with a projector and some whiteboards/flip chart paper.
                    This workshop is occasionally run publicly via training providers or conferences but most are private, on-site workshops held directly with organisations.

                    This is an example Container diagram for a fictional Internet Banking System. It shows that the Internet Banking System (the dashed box) is made up of five containers:
                    a server-side Web Application, a Single-Page Application, a Mobile App, a server-side API Application, and a Database.
                    The Web Application is a Java/Spring MVC web application that simply serves static content (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), including the content that makes up the Single-Page Application.
                    The Single-Page Application is an Angular application that runs in the customer's web browser, providing all of the Internet banking features.
                    Alternatively, customers can use the cross-platform Xamarin Mobile App, to access a subset of the Internet banking functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both the Single-Page Application and Mobile App use a JSON/HTTPS API, which is provided by another Java/Spring MVC application running on the server.
                    The API Application gets user information from the Database (a relational database schema).
                    The API Application also communicates with the existing Mainframe Banking System, using a propreitary XML/HTTPS interface, to get information about bank accounts or make transactions. 
                    The API Application also uses the existing E-mail System if it needs to send e-mails to customers.

                    This is an example Component diagram for a fictional Internet Banking System, showing some (rather than all) of the components within the API Application.
                    Here, there are two Spring MVC Rest Controllers providing access points for the JSON/HTTPS API, with each controller subsequently using other components to access data from the Database and Mainframe Banking System.

                    This is an example (and partial) UML class diagram for a fictional Internet Banking System, showing the code elements (interfaces and classes) that make up the MainframeBankingSystemFacade component.
                    It shows that the component is made up of a number of classes, with the implementation details directly reflecting the code.
